Techniques Used:
I chose to use DistilBert because from what I read, it is a good model to use for classifying customer reviews as positive or negative.
My trainer ran into overfitting problems because the csv file I used only had 100 entries, so I implemented early stopping onto the Trainer and set the early_stopping_patience to 3.
With early stopping, some of the training metrics for my model did not unaturally remain at 1.0 throughout the training process.
